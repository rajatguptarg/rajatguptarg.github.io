## Story
I am an engineering manager passionate about building systems aligning reliability and security goals with measurable business outcomes. Over the past decade I have led platform, SRE, and developer productivity teams across fintech and SaaS companies, growing high-performing teams while modernizing infrastructure.

I care about clarity, good systems, and work that actually moves a team forward. I manage engineering teams, and I like solving problems that sit where reliability, security, and backend engineering meet. My approach is simple: understand the system, understand the people, remove the friction, and let teams do their best work.

I like direct communication and decisions backed by real data. When something is ambiguous, I push to make it clear. When something is inefficient, I fix it. When ownership is missing, I draw the lines so everyone knows where they stand.

Outside the day to day, I write about engineering leadership, platform thinking, and the lessons that come from building reliable systems with real teams under real constraints. My goal is the same in writing as it is at work; make things easier to understand and easier to act on.


## Principles I Lead With
- **Reliability with empathy** — healthy SLOs, compassionate incident reviews, and tight feedback loops with product teams.
- **Secure-by-default platforms** — paved roads, dependency governance, and threat modeling as part of delivery.
- **Craft + Clarity** — high standards paired with transparent communication so teams can execute autonomously.
- **Mentorship** — developing engineers into tech leads through pairing, design reviews, and career coaching.

## Outside of Work
When I am not debugging platforms, you can find me writing about leadership and open source, speaking at community events, or hiking with my camera. I am always up for collaborating on talks or mentoring emerging engineering leaders.
