## Story
I am an engineering manager passionate about aligning reliability and security goals with measurable business outcomes. Over the past decade I have led platform, SRE, and developer productivity teams across fintech and SaaS companies, growing high-performing teams while modernizing infrastructure.

## Principles I Lead With
- **Reliability with empathy** — healthy SLOs, compassionate incident reviews, and tight feedback loops with product teams.
- **Secure-by-default platforms** — paved roads, dependency governance, and threat modeling as part of delivery.
- **Craft + Clarity** — high standards paired with transparent communication so teams can execute autonomously.
- **Mentorship** — developing engineers into tech leads through pairing, design reviews, and career coaching.

## Outside of Work
When I am not debugging platforms, you can find me writing about leadership and open source, speaking at community events, or hiking with my camera. I am always up for collaborating on talks or mentoring emerging engineering leaders.
