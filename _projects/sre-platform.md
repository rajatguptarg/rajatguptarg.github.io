## Context
Rapid product growth produced dozens of bespoke service stacks. Teams lacked standard tooling for deployments, metrics, and incident response.

## Approach
- Partnered with platform, security, and developer experience groups to define golden paths.
- Delivered Terraform modules, GitHub Actions templates, and dashboards that shipped together.
- Embedded SREs on each product team to coach and capture feedback.

## Outcome
New services launched 40% faster, cost anomalies were caught within hours, and the company adopted uniform SLOs with quarterly reviews.
