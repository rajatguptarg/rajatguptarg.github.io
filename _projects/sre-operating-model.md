## Context
TIDAL's music streaming footprint spanned mobile, living room, and partner integrations, but SRE responsibilities were fragmented across 14 squads. Only a handful of services had meaningful SLOs, incident reviews, or ownership metadata, which made it difficult to prioritise resilience along with feature work.

## My Role
As the Engineering Manager for TIDAL's SRE group I was accountable for the roadmap, stakeholder alignment, and the coaching plan that helped every squad adopt SRE practices. I facilitated executive readouts on reliability metrics, unblocked budget for tooling, and paired with tech leads while they defined SLOs, runbooks, and automation guardrails.

## What I Led
- Partnered with Engineering and Product leadership to tie SLOs, SLIs, runbooks, and service-tier classifications to business objectives and OKRs.
- Ran enablement workshops that walked teams through defining customer journeys, calculating error budgets, and building actionable dashboards.
- Embedded with squads to co-author runbooks and automate incident escalation paths through the IDP, so documentation lived where engineers already worked.
- Introduced post-incident coaching sessions plus DORA metrics reporting to keep continuous improvement visible to executives.

## Results
- All 14 product teams adopted the model; incident MTTR dropped by half while platform reliability scores rose 80%.
- Service-tier clarity aligned investment with risk, enabling deliberate trade-offs during roadmap planning.
- Runbooks and automated incident flows are now part of the standard definition of done, giving new teams a proven playbook from day one.
