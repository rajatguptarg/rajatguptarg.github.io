## Context
Compliance needs were growing faster than the small security team could handle. Engineering needed scalable guardrails instead of bespoke reviews.

## Approach
- Created reusable threat modeling checklists per service tier.
- Automated dependency scanning and container policy enforcement in CI/CD.
- Launched security champions guild to distribute expertise.

## Outcome
Time to approve launches dropped by 60%, and quarterly audits returned zero critical findings for the first time.
